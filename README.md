<h1>Strings and Indexing in Python</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Security analysts work with a lot of string data. For example, some security analysts work on creating and updating IDs such as employee IDs and device IDs, which are commonly represented as strings. As another example, certain network activity will be stored as string data. Becoming comfortable working with strings in Python is essential for the work of a security analyst. <br/>
<br />
In this lab, you'll practice creating Python code and working with strings. You'll work with an employee ID, a device ID, and a URL, all represented as string data.
<br/>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
You're working as a security analyst, and you are responsible for writing programs in Python to automate updating employee IDs, extracting characters from a device ID, and extracting components from a URL.
